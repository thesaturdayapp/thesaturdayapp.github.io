    	    <p>Saturday v0.3.0 is the greatest app we have ever made.</p>
          <p><strong>Improvements in Groups</strong></p>
    			<p>In addition to private groups, you can now start public groups. Anybody can join public groups and contribute videos. Public groups cannot be made private once created. Finally, the Home screen was completely redesigned to organize groups and improve the efficiency of video uploads.</p>
          <p><strong>Changes to Profile</strong></p>
          <p>The user profile is now private by default; other users will not be able to see your liked videos or the number of followers you have.</p>
          <p><strong>Saved Videos</strong></p>
          <p>There is now an option to save videos locally. These videos are not uploaded, and instead will appear only on your Profile page on your device. If you log out or delete the app, you will lose these saved videos.</p>
          <p><strong>New Filters</strong></p>
          <p>This version includes three new filters, namely Dim, C7T, and Glitch. (Note: filters are subject to frequent change.)</p>
          <p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
          <p>We fixed a ton of bugs throughout the app and achieved an experience that's as smooth as butter.</p>

      <p>We made a huge improvement in the video player; videos will now play much faster and run smoother when advancing.</p>

      <p>The first thing you'll notice is the new camera layout. We purposefully added these changes to help faciliate faster flow from capture to share.</p>

      <p>Besides the camera, we redesigned elements throughout the app: everything from the Settings screen to the error messages were improved.</p>

      <p>Some honorable menions: the camera runs much faster, several annoying bugs were terminated, and Saturday looks great on the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR.</p></div>

      <p><b>Bug fixes.</b> The most critical bug we fixed previoulsy caused the app to crash during the sign up process. Besides that, we solved several other bugs, some of which were needlessly using precious memory.</p>
      <p><b>Improvements.</b> The app has been given a slight aesthetic enhancement throughout.</p>

      <p>The second bug consisted of a single <code>if</code> expression (no hyperbole here) preventing the group name from being updated. In the industry, we like to call this "group name stasis" (okay nobody calls it that, but we did fix it).</p></div>

      <div class="details"><p>Saturday v 0.1.22 is our best version yet. The largest improvement is the camera. We rewrote the entire camera from scratch, and you'll be glad we did. Among several improvements, the camera runs much smoother and is significantly faster at processing your video clips. We decided to make this change for two primary reasons:</p><ol><li>We want the process of capturing video to feel natural&mdash;almost like the camera is an extension of your hand.</li><li>Our new camera lends us lots of flexibility to try out crazy new ideas.</li></ol><p>Besides the new camera, we made several small design modifications throughout and countless bug fixes. Here are just two examples:</p><ul><li>You can now enter up to 140 characters in your profile bio</li><li>We fixed a bug that prevented the app from playing direct message videos</li></ul><p>We're hard at work building the next version of Saturday.

      <div class="details"><p>This is our greatest version yet, and we really think you'll enjoy it 😉</p>
      <p>We replaced an relatively large part of our codebase with some cutting-edge stuff. That's why this update took quite sometime. And it was worth it: the app is <em>much</em> more performant.</p>
      <p>While writing some of that cutting-edge code, we also added some new features, fixed countless bugs, and made large improvements to the overall performance.</p>
      <p>Here's what's new:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can now like a video multiple times&mdash;just swipe up! ❤️💜💚 You can find the dislike option under the options button in the top right corner of the video player.</li>
        <li>Red circle appears under your thumb when you tap to record.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where profile image was occasionally not being uploaded.</li>
        <li>Removed bug where touch events did not register.</li>
        <li>You can now play videos directly from the notifications page.</li>
        <li>Resolved a handful of bugs that would crash the app.</li>
      </ul></div>

        <li>Removed issue that caused video caption to display previously typed text.</li>
        <li>Removed superfluous autofill option that occasionally preloaded gibberish into the username field.</li>

      <div class="details"><p><strong>New features.</strong> Saturday has been given a thorough redesign from top to bottom. We built a new product, Groups, to help connect with friends in a fun and meaningful way. We added a cool special effects feature to the camera: SplitLens. SplitLens allows you to capture two half-screen videos, and then it stitches the two videos together into one video clip. Fun stuff.</p>
      <p><strong>Bug fixes.</strong> We fixed bugs that would crash the app or freeze video playback. Furthermore, we also spotted some cosmetic "bugs" that were removed in this release.</p>
      <p><strong>Improvements.</strong> We've made it easier to invite your friends to the app (you can invite friends by tapping the top-left corner button under the profile tab). We also added a mechanism to email us from inside the app (tap the first option on the settings page).</p></div>
